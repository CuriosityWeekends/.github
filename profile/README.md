## 📚 Our Story

Founded in 2024 by a group of passionate high schoolers, Curiosity Weekends has grown into a thriving initiative supported by:

- 📌 The **Little KITES** community (joined Feb 2025)  
- 🏫 **Linnk Academy**, which offered a permanent weekend workspace (April 2025)

We’re united by one principle: *mastery isn't a moment—it's a habit.*
