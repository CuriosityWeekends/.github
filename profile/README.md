## 📌 Project Structure & Workflow

### 🗂️ Project Repositories

- All new projects must be created as **individual repositories** within the organization.
- Once a repo is created, it must be added to the **Project: Tortoise** board under the appropriate status category.

### 📋 Project Board – `Tortoise`

All ongoing and proposed work is tracked using the following columns:

- 💡 **Suggestions** – Early ideas or proposals  
- 📝 **To Do** – Approved and ready for execution  
- 🔄 **In Progress** – Actively being worked on  
- ✅ **Done** – Completed tasks/projects  
- 🛒 **To Buy** – Resources/tools needed  
- 📦 **Bought** – Purchased/logged items

## 🔁 Daily Activity Protocol

**All regular contributors** are expected to post daily updates via GitHub:

- 🔹 **Morning:** Post your planned task(s) for the day (minimum one).
- 🔹 **Evening:** Log what you actually completed or explored.

This ensures accountability and fosters community visibility into each member's learning journey.

## 👥 Who We Are

**Curiosity Weekends** began in 2024, founded by a group of motivated high school students. Since then:

- 📌 In **Feb 2025**, the **Little KITES** team from Kasaragod joined the initiative.
- 🏫 In **April 2025**, **Linnk Academy** provided a dedicated space for project sessions.

Today, we continue to build on the idea that **mastery is a habit**, not a moment. Weekends are our engine for that journey.
